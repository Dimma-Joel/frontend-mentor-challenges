- How to use max and min widths

- Modern CSS resets

### Continued development

- Media queries

- Responsive designs

### Useful resources

- [Modern CSS reset by John Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) - This helped me to learn new CSS resets. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Media Queries by MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand media queries. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
